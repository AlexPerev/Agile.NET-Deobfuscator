# Agile.NET Deobfuscator
 Deobfuscates Agile.NET controlflow, strings, and proxy delegates. Their is a problem with the delegate fixer, as it does not work properly on entrypoints/constructors(will be fixed once i find the cause of the issue). Either then that, please let me know for new updates or any other problems. Throughout the full source on every line it contains comments so you can easily understand the process behind it. Enjoy!
